/*
Why we write '+ 1' in line number 2 ?
-> Math.random() ,it gives the number from 0(inlcusive) to 1(exclusive) so here if we not add +1 then we mention as max 101 but with this 100 can possible but never come 1 .. as our problem statment we want random number from 1 to 100 ...not from 0 to 100 ..
